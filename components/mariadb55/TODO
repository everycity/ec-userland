This package (and MySQL 5.5 as well) have omitted shipping
various things such as the sql-bench and mysql-test parts
due to CMAKE putting them in $(ECPREFIX)/ instead of under
$(ECPREFIX)/mariadb/5.5. This was due to time constraints.
They should probably also be in separate packages.

Also the splitting up of the files into 3 separate packages
has been done suboptimally - a "mask" of some description
to send things to the right location may be in order.

Finally, MariaDB is kind of in conflict with MySQL as far
as $(ECPREFIX)/bin/XXXX ->
    $(ECPREFIX)/lib/(mysql|mariadb)/active/bin/XXXX
symlinks are concerned. A workaround however is to simply
install the mysql-55/client package and symlink:
$(ECPREFIX)/lib/mysql/active ->
  $(ECPREFIX)/lib/mariadb/5.5
