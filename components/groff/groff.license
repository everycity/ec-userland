  Hyphenation Patterns
  --------------------

  . The file `tmac/hyphen.us' is identical to the file `hyphen.tex', part of
    the TeX system written by Donald E. Knuth; the master file can be found
    at

      ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/tex/dist/lib/hyphen.tex    .

    It has been renamed for consistency, i.e., to make patterns available
    under the filenames `hyphen.<language>', e.g. `hyphen.de' or
    `hyphen.uk'.

    See the file itself for a copyright notice.

  . The file `tmac/hyphen.fr' contains the same patterns as the file
    `frhyph.tex' (for TeX), which can be found at

      http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/frhyph.tex    .

    The patterns have been converted to a format groff can understand.

    See the file itself for a copyright notice.

  . The file `tmac/hyphen.sv' is identical to the file `svhyph.tex', which
    can be found at

      http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/svhyph.tex    .

    See the file itself for a copyright notice.

  . The files `tmac/hyphen.det' and `tmac/hyphen.den' contain the same
    patterns as the files `dehyphn.tex' and `dehypht.tex' (for TeX), which
    can be found at

      http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/dehyphn.tex
      http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/dehypht.tex    .

    The patterns have been converted to a format groff can understand.

    See the files themselves for a copyright notice.

  . The file `tmac/hyphenex.det' is identical to the file `dehyphtex.tex',
    which can be found at

      http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/dehyphtex.tex    .

    See the file itself for a copyright notice.

  . The file `tmac/hyphen.cs' contains the same patterns as the file
    `czhyphen.tex' (for TeX), which can be found in the archive

      http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/macros/cstex/base/csplain.tar.gz    .

    The patterns have been converted to a format groff can understand.

    See the file itself for a copyright notice.
