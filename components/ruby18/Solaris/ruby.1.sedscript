.SH FILES\
The following files specify the installation  locations  for Ruby: \
.PP\
.TP\
/ec/var/ruby/1.8/gem_home \
Contains the Rubygems repository. Configure the GEM_HOME environment variable \
to point to /ec/var/ruby/1.8/gem_home as the installation of Rubygems repository.\
.PP\
.TP\
/ec/var/ruby/1.8/gem_home/bin \
Contains executables for any installed gems that have them (i.e.: thin, rake, \
rails, etc). Only exists after a gem with an executable has been installed.\
.PP\
.TP\
~/.gem/ruby/1.8 \
Location that gems will be installed to if /ec/var/ruby/1.8/gem_home is not \
writable by the user. This is automatically added to GEM_PATH.\
.PP\
.TP\
~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin\
Location that executables for gems will be installed to if \
/ec/var/ruby/1.8/gem_home/bin is not writable by the user.\
.PP\
.TP\
/ec/bin/ruby1.8 \
Contains  the  Ruby  executable  as well as other utility programs, and \
Rubygems programs. These programs are linked from /usr/bin.\
For example: /ec/bin/ruby1.8/ruby is linked from /usr/bin/ruby1.8, and \
may be linked from /usr/bin/ruby if 1.8 is the latest version of Ruby \
installed on this system. \
