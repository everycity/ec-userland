     Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

     This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
     text is available at
           http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
     The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
     (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
     any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
     copyrighted.

     The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
     <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
     that follows (in reverse chronological order):

     2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
           references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
           now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
     1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
     1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
           added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
           Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
     1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

   Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
   - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
     between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
     version is still 5 times faster, though.
   - Arguments more compliant with Python standard
