FAQ:
====

The questions and answers below try to summarize the intentions behind this
licensing scheme.

Q: Is it possible to create derived works of syslog-ng under the GPL/LGPL
licenses?

A: Yes, that's exactly the point of open source. Works derived from the
plugins will have to use the GPL license, but you can choose to use LGPL for
them as well.

Q: Do I need to sign a Contributory License Agreement in order for my
contribution to be accepted?

A: No, starting with syslog-ng 3.2, you don't need to sign a CLA in order to
have your contributions accepted.

Q: Is it possible to create non-free plugins for syslog-ng?

A: Yes. It is our understanding that plugins are derived works of the
syslog-ng core but not derived works of other plugins.  Thus, non-free
plugins are possible, provided they do not link to any of the GPLd plugins
explicitly and the only connection between two plugins is via the syslog-ng
core.

Q: Who is permitted to create non-free plugins for syslog-ng? Is it just
BalaBit (the current copyright holder as of the initial 3.2 release)?

A: No, everyone including BalaBit.
