This package relies on autoconf-213 to install.  autoconf-213 is not in the
IPS repo as it is a PITA to get to install alongside the version we want.  If
anyone wants to complete autoconf-213 the starting point is committed to the
hg repo.

To build this package, therefore, you should manually install autoconf-213 in
your build environment without the IPS autoconf then clean up and revert to
the proper autoconf afterwards.

The spidermonkey.p5m.off file is the correct manifest for this component but
is deliberately misnamed to stop it getting built in full repo builds that
will not have the correct autoconf.
