# /etc/logindevperm - login-based device permissions
#
# If the user is logging in on a device specified in the "console" field
# of any entry in this file, the owner/group of the devices listed in the
# "devices" field will be set to that of the user.  Similarly, the mode
# will be set to the mode specified in the "mode" field.
#
# "devices" is a colon-separated list of device names.  A device name
# ending in "/*", such as "/dev/fbs/*", specifies all entries (except "."
# and "..") in a directory.  A '#' begins a comment and may appear
# anywhere in an entry.
# In addition, regular expressions may be used. Refer to logindevperm(4)
# man page.
# Note that any changes in this file should be made when logged in as
# root as devfs provides persistence on minor node attributes.
