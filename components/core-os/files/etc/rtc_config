#	This file (/etc/rtc_config) contains information used to manage the
#	x86 real time clock hardware.  The hardware is kept in
#	the machine's local time for compatibility with other x86
#	operating systems.  This file is read by the kernel at
#	boot time.  It is set and updated by the /usr/sbin/rtc
#	command.  The 'zone_info' field designates the local
#	time zone.  The 'zone_lag' field indicates the number
#	of seconds between local time and Greenwich Mean Time.
