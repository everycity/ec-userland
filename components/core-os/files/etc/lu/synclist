# These are files that will be synchronized up if we change from one BE to
# another.
#
# The entries can be files or directories. If a directory is given, all
# of the contents of that directory (including subdirectories) will be copied.
# The second field is the method of update. There are 3 choices:
#
# OVERWRITE	The sync process will completely overwrite the contents
#		of the new BE file (on startup of activated BE) with the
#		contents of the same file of the previously booted BE.
#		OVERWRITE is the default action if no action is
#		specified in the second field. Directories and files
#		can be listed as OVERWRITE. For directories, every file in
# 		a listed directory will be overwritten. The new BE
#		file will have the same date, mode, and ownership as
#		the same file on the previous BE.
#
# APPEND	The sync process will append the contents
#		of the previously booted BE file to new BE file
#		(on startup of activated BE). Be aware that this may
#		lead to duplicate entries in the file.
#		Directories can not be listed as APPEND.
# 		The new BE file will have the modified date/time.
# 		The new BE file will maintain its mode and ownership.
#		ownership as the same file on the previous BE.
#
# PREPEND	The sync process will prepend the contents
#		of the previously booted BE file to new BE file
#		(on startup of activated BE). Be aware that this may
#		lead to duplicate entries in the file.
#		Directories can not be listed as PREPEND.
# 		The new BE file will have the modified date/time.
# 		The new BE file will maintain its mode and ownership.
#		ownership as the same file on the previous BE.
#
# It is important to fully understand that adding other files not
# listed here could cause a system to become unbootable.
